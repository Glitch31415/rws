Thank you for wanting to set up your own RWS server!

First, install the latest JDK.

Next, install the VARA modem. If you want to put the server on 14.110 (recommended), choose the VARA HF version.

Now, download the latest "vrws.jar" from https://github.com/Glitch31415/rws/releases.

To run the server, first start the VARA modem (VARA.exe), and make sure your settings are as follows:

Command Port: 8300
Data Port: 8301
KISS Port: 8100 (not used at the moment)
Accept 500 Hz Connections should be checked
Tuner Enhancement should be unchecked
CW ID should be checked if you are in the US (and is good practice in general)
KISS Interface should be checked (not used at the moment but might be in the future)
I would recommend setting Retries to 2, at most. It causes less interference to other stations answering CQs and for the server to be used effectively the link should be strong enough to not need more than 2 retries.

Finally, open cmd.exe and type in "java -jar [path to jar]" replacing [path to jar] with the full path of the vrws.jar file (example: C:\Users\glitch\Downloads\vrws.jar).
Fill in the extra data as it asks and your server will be active! Set your radio frequency to 14.110 MHz USB, and PTT to VOX.
